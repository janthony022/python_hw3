# 1) Build a Shopping Cart
# You can use either lists or dictionaries. The program should have the following capabilities:

# 1) Takes in input
# 2) Stores user input into a dictionary or list
# 3) The User can add or delete items
# 4) The User can see current shopping list
# 5) The program Loops until user 'quits'
# 6) Upon quiting the program, print out all items in the user's list
# from IPython.display import clear_output
